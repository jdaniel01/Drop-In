All metal coping. Big extensions in the 4 foot and in the 8 foot middle section. The 8 foot middle one has a channel in the middle, used for entry and for airs over. Really nice design, really smooth and fast. The flow area is fun too, small, but you can launch from the 4 foot deep part right over the platform into the banks of the flow. A few street objects surround the bowl and flow area for the kiddies to railslide and sit on while watching the session. It's only 2 dollars and it is open till 9 or 10 depending on the time of year. Best park in the Sacramento area by far, and only an hours drive from Strawberry bowl, so do a double header if you do the Folsom thing. It is a half hour from downtown Sacramento.
